Coding convention.

* Don't use exceptions in anyway in dubylib. You can use try..except, but never raise.
  Use functions returning Boolean (or Integers) instead.
  
  Objects must always be created. Use an object flag to indicate that object is ready for work or not 
  (to avoid using exception in constructors)
