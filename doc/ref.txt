== Unit:dbgTypes ==

The unit contains main types declared for the library.
It also introduces the core debugging class TDbgTarget.

TDbgTarget is simply a class wrapper over underlaying system debug API.

The user should never create TDbgTarget directly (via class constructor). Instread
the one must use allocator functions:
  DebugProcessStart
  DebugProcessAttach (not implemented)


== Unit:dbgMain ==

todo: rename to dbgClassic

The unit provides Object Wrappers over TDbgTarget low-level API.
it also provides an additional easy-to-use breakpoints handling in TDbgProcess class

=== TDbgThread ===

The object wrapper to a debugged thread. The thread is used to examine register status,
enable or disable step-by-step debugging.
   
=== TDbgProcess ===

The object wrapper for a debugged process. The wrappers handles reading/writting process memory,
stores the list of process threads and list of breakpoints set in the process mem space.

=== TDbgMain ===

Is the main access to a debugged target, holds list of debugged processes (only one or more).
