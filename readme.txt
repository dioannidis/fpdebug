hello

this project is my graduation work. So, generally i'm the most interested in getting this project done :)

the second, and probably even more important task, is to implement FreePascal based debugger, so it can be
used by any object-pascal (FreePascal) based application.

whole code will be written in {$mode delphi}, so, at least, windows version should be delphi 7 compatible.
i will soon upload source file.

the project is inspired, by fpdbg - simple 64-bit Win debugger by Marc Weustnik (fpc/lazarus team developer)
you can find his project at Lazarus/debugger


thanks,
dmitry aka skalogryz
